# Spam Detection System

## 📌 About This Project
The **Spam Detection System** is a machine learning-based approach designed to identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning algorithms** to analyze text data and predict whether a given message is spam or not.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- **Automated Spam Detection:** Uses a trained model to classify messages as spam or not spam.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements **Logistic Regression** for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
- **Deployment Ready:** Can be integrated into email filtering systems, SMS applications, and chat moderation tools.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled SMS messages categorized as spam or ham (not spam).

📌 **Dataset Source:** [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Text Cleaning:** Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
2. **Tokenization & Lemmatization:** Converting text into meaningful tokens.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converting textual data into numerical format.
4. **Splitting Data:** 80% training, 20% testing.
