# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially true if you are developing a library, as it ensures that the library is
#   tested against the exact versions of its dependencies that are specified in the lock file.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, poetry may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
#   However, some settings like tool.pdm.dev-dependencies are useful to be shared.
#   You may add it to .gitignore for your project as needed.
#.pdm.toml
#   pdm also stores its cache in .pdm-cache by default, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
